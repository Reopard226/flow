## Contributing

We follow Git Flow process, a branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. Simply:

- Create a branch for a new feature or topic you want to work on
- Add your commits with clear messages to help your fellow team follow and provide feedback
- Open a Pull Request for discussion and code review
- Core member will approve and merge

Our CI/CD deploys to multiple environments: `Development`, `Staging`, `Production`.
